                <p> Notably, these are the only commercial missions that India's heaviest launcher has performed. OneWeb Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal revealed the contribution of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in facilitating these commercial launches with ISRO, which falls under the Department of Space that is part of the prime minister's portfolio. 
                 On the occasion of the completion of OneWeb's Gen1 constellation, Mittal said that India stepped up to help when the Bharti group and UK-govt backed company faced serious setbacks. Recalling the tough situation, he said that the Russia-Ukraine war had led to the cancellation of six launches that were contracted with the Russian space agency Roscosmos. </p>

                <p>Washington D.C.Edited By: Mukul SharmaUpdated: Mar 26, 2023, 03:27 PM IST</p>
                <p>"We have seen disturbing visuals of a senior Indian journalist from Press Trust of India being abused, threatened and assaulted physically while covering so called ‘Khalistan protest’ in Washington DC. We understand that the journalist was first verbally intimidated, then physically assaulted, and fearing for his personal safety and well-being, had to call in law enforcement agencies, who responded promptly," Indian embassy in Washington said in an official statement. 

                    "We condemn such a grave and unwarranted attack on a senior journalist. Such activities only underscore the violent and anti-social tendencies of the so called 'Khalistani protesters' and their supporters, who routinely engage in wanton violence and vandalism," it added.</p>
